I am a *17-year-old* student at **ACS**. I have been living in Jordan for two years. I play the piano and the tenor saxophone. I have two sisters who are both younger than me. I plan to study mechanical or aerospace engineering at university. I am the son of a Canadian diplomat and I have lived in:
1. Ethiopia
2. Ivory Coast
3. Jordan
4. Canada

I have begun this account to experiment as part of a school assignment. I am hoping to learn the basics of code that will allow me to create more complex things.
